// * What is this component, really? It should take a list of things and render them
//? What things ?
// * A list of photos
// * A list of headings
// * A list of teasers
// * A list of contact cards
// * A list of teasers where the text / image / ctas / paths are optional
// ? Is it fair to say that this can always take a TEASER component, then? - probably.
